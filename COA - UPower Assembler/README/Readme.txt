To execute the simulator in jupyter notebook, install python 2.7 kernel, open the .ipynb notebook.
Then, just execute based on the instructions given in the notebook.

To execute the individual python files,
The python version has to be python 2.7.
If Python 3.6 has already been installed, use a virtual environment to run this python 2.7 code.

First check which question you want to execute.
Then open q.py file and set the copy to the '.s' file required.

Then run the following commands.

1.  python q.py
2.  python pass1.py
3.  python pass2.py
4a. python memory.py 0  --> for step by step execution
4b. python memory.py 1  --> for full execution

The files included are:

Q1.s, Q2.s, Q3.s, Q4.s          -   uPower Assembly Programs
pass1.py, pass2.py, memory.py   -   Python code files
label.txt, ref.txt              -   Products of pass1.py
opcode.o, opcodeindex.txt       -   Products of pass2.py
memory.txt, data.txt            -   Products of memory.py


The purpose of each of the files have been explained in the demo video.
While executing step by step, 
keep the memory.txt file open to see the changes happening to the register values.

For the demo video, a youtube playlist has been made.
