All the below tasks have been successfully demonstrated in the video.

Demo the following for full credit:
1. uPOWER ISA programs
2. Assembly, Disassembly of the programs.
3. System Initialization on Simulator startup, and after program load.
4. Execution of the assembly programs.

Partial credit - If whole assembly code cannot be demonstrated, write
dummy code with uPOWER ISA instructions and to show capabilities of
the

Bonus:
1. Pause at an instruction, and step-wise execution
2. Simulator is capable of simulating (almost) all of the instructions
from the uPOWER ISA.
3. Show all versions of the code - v0.1 to v1.0 and beyond (as in the
assignment video/pdf)
